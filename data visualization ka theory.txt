Aim: Data Visualization using R.
Theory:
Data visualization is the technique used to deliver insights in data using visual cues such as graphs, charts, maps, 
and many others. This is useful as it helps in intuitive and easy understanding of the large quantities of data and 
thereby make better decisions regarding it. The popular data visualization tools that are available are Tableau, 
Plotly, R, Google Charts, Infogram, and Kibana. The various data visualization platforms have different capabilities, 
functionality, and use cases. They also require a different skill set. This article discusses the use of R for data 
visualization. R is a language that is designed for statistical computing, graphical data analysis, and scientific 
research. It is usually preferred for data visualization as it offers flexibility and minimum required coding through its 
packages
